Building a Phishing Detection Model
Overview
Phishing attacks continue to be a prevalent threat to individuals and organizations, leading to compromised accounts, stolen sensitive information, and financial losses. Building an effective phishing detection model is crucial to mitigate these risks. This repository contains the code and resources to develop a phishing detection model using machine learning techniques.

Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluating the phishing detection model is sourced from source. It contains features extracted from URLs, including domain information, URL length, presence of specific keywords, and other relevant attributes. The dataset is labeled, with phishing URLs marked as malicious and legitimate URLs marked as benign.

Model Development
The phishing detection model is built using Python and popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy. The following steps outline the model development process:

Data Preprocessing: The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.

Feature Engineering: Additional features may be engineered from the existing dataset to improve model performance.

Model Selection: Several machine learning algorithms are considered, including logistic regression, random forests, gradient boosting, and support vector machines (SVM).

Model Training: The selected machine learning algorithms are trained on the preprocessed dataset.

Model Evaluation: The trained models are evaluated using various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Cross-validation techniques may be employed to ensure robustness.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Hyperparameters of the chosen models are fine-tuned using techniques like grid search or random search to optimize performance.

Model Deployment: Once a satisfactory model is identified, it is deployed for real-time phishing detection.
